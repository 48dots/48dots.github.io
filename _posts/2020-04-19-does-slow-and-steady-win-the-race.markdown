There were a thousand things I *could* be doing. There were a hundred things I *should* be doing. Yet, once again, I tore open a bag of Takis, picked up my phone, and scrolled through a sea of cat videos with my powder coated crimson fingers.

I knew I'd look back at that moment in an hour with disgust. But I've been here before - many times. I couldn't help myself. The tempting glow of my screen has been designed to reel me in, just like those crunchy red cylinders of goodness. Mmmmmm. Takis.

I had big dreams as a little kid. When I put down 'CEO' on the form for middle school job shadow day, my teacher scoffed at me. "Being a CEO isn't a career! You can't go to school to be a CEO!" she quipped. Twelve-year-old me puffed up with pride. *"I'll show her!"* I thought. 

Yet here I was, a decade later, scrolling through pointless content and supplementing my love handles with enough calories to feed a village for a month.

I certainly wasn't a CEO, nor was I on track to become one any time soon. This wasn't just a single moment of weakness. I was letting my childhood self - that starry eyed dreamer - down. Maybe my teacher was right.

**How could I ever fulfill my childhood goals, and prove to myself that I could realize my full potential?** I was letting myself succumb to pleasure. And not even a pleasure that I really wanted! *These violent delights have violent ends.*

A few weeks later, I had a day of complete productivity. Everything was going right, walls were crumbling all around me, and I knocked out tasks that hadn't been accomplished for months. If every day was like this, I'd be the king of the world!

As I got in my car to head home, I realized what was different. I had accidentally left my phone in the car!

So I tried an experiment. I left my phone in my glove compartment every day as I headed into the office. The results told the story.

It was clear - I had to become the Gautama Buddha of the 21st century. I just needed to set my worldly pleasures aside, and I would be on the fast track to success.

And it worked - for a bit. But the cracks started forming. People tried to reach me with important messages, but couldn't get a hold of me. I needed to make a quick call to the bank during working hours, but I couldn't. Worst of all, I would go on a marathon internet binge as soon as I got home, spending all my time catching up on the "important" cat videos I had missed during the day.

I loosened the reins a little, trying to find some balance. I let myself bring my phone into work, but set timers on my apps to limit my usage. That worked - until it didn't. I realized I could just tap a button to bypass the restrictions, and carry on with my overindulgence.

**I was back to square one.**

My aha moment came months later, as I was updating my career goals at work. This was something I had done throughout my career, never thinking too much about its significance. But these goals were precisely what I ran toward when I took the distractions away. With the right amount of focus, I was achieving them. 

But I didn't have these goals for other parts of my life. Outside of work, I was in a state of stagnation. I thought it was the distractions around me that were holding me back. I was trying to burn down the Library of Alexandria because I couldn't keep myself out of the comics section. *But the real reason I was going to the comics section in the first place was because I didn't know where else to go!*

I already knew what my life goals were in an abstract sense. But reflecting on the person I wanted to be let me crystallize where I needed to go. Writing out my goals gave me a map to follow for every facet of my life. 

Everyone knows the story of the tortoise and the hare. The slow tortoise challenges the fast hare to a race. The hare is so confident in his victory that he takes a nap partway through, and the tortoise - the technical underdog - wins.

But perhaps there is a different way to look at this story. By all accounts, the hare should have won the race. He was a high achiever, naturally gifted at running. His mistake was that he let pride go to his head, and took a nap along the way. 

**In my case, I've been napping at the starting line.** I knew there was a race to run, but I didn't know the course. 

Now I have know where to go. Now I have a map.

Maybe I'll stop for a quick break along the way. Smell the flowers. Munch on some Takis. But as long as I keep my compass pointed at the finish line, I can win the race.

*A hare with their eye on the prize will beat a tortoise any day of the week.*
