Sinking into my pillowy mattress, drawing the soft sheets over my face, letting the obligations of the world fade away. My eyelids grow heavy and slowly draw closed. There is nothing more rewarding than a well timed nap - a break from the bustle of the world. 

Yet, naps in the modern workplace are a rare event. We head to the office early in the morning and come home late at night. Napping on the job is frowned on, a fireable offense in many places. Secretly sneaking off to our cars for a quick snooze in a moment of desperation may be the closest thing to a siesta we get.

It may have taken a literal pandemic, but I've finally found the environment to embrace my inner preschooler and relearn how to nap. Spending most of my waking hours burrowed in my bedroom, I no longer need to sneak around to get some shut-eye. Nor do I need my employer to invest in a fancy nap pod. All I need is an empty hole in my calendar.

There are two elements to the perfect nap - *"when"* and *"how long"*.

The *when* is easy. Though it may always seem like a good time to snuggle under some warm sheets, there are some times when a nap is simply dangerous. Unless I'm trying to become nocturnal, a nap after 4PM is deadly. I've found the perfect nap to be in the early afternoon. Right when the sun starts sinking in the sky, my lunch starts to digest, and my eyelids start getting a little droopy.

The *how long* is much harder. 

Too short, and my nap is a stressful race against time. I repeatedly glance at my clock, trying to close my eyes quickly enough for the nap to be worth it. By the time I'm finally asleep, it's already over. I'm jarred awake by the brash buzzer, slamming all of my senses into high alert and shocking me back to reality. 

Too long, and it's the opposite problem. The nap becomes sleep, and an hour or two is simply too short for a *proper* sleep. I wake up groggy, hungry, and more tired than when I started.

Each new study seems to contradict prior research. [The best nap is 10 minutes.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16796222) Actually, no, [the best nap is greater than 35 minutes.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31491444) Wait - [don't nap for more than 20 minutes!](https://www.sleepfoundation.org/insomnia/treatment/should-you-nap) Now, I don't mean to [trivialize scientific studies](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Rnq1NpHdmw&has_verified=1), but my own experiments have shown that **the perfect nap is 36 minutes.** This is based on no science, no studies, no brain scans. 

This nap length is the perfect state of superposition - long enough where time doesn't matter, but short enough where it still does. When I hop into my bed, I don't have to frantically try to fall asleep instantly. I can lay in bed, pull out a good book, and read a few pages as my eyes drift out of focus, the black text on white paper slowly blurring to gray.

Thirty-six minutes is long enough for me to wake up before my alarm goes off most of the time. The chirp of a bird outside my window. The sun shining at just the right angle to bathe its warm glow on my eyes. A cool breeze blowing through, gently rustling me awake. I can savor this simple pleasure as I slowly bring myself back to consciousness.

Even if I don't awake naturally, 36 minutes is long enough for me to feel well rested. While that blaring alarm might not be as welcome as the gentle chirp of a songbird, I can still wake up content and well rested.

Naps are great, but **these lessons don't just stop at napping.**
 
We live in a world where so-called "productivity gurus" hawk stories of herculean self-discipline. We need to wake up at 4AM, strip out every single distraction, chug another Red Bull and keep going late into the night. Rinse, repeat, and do it again for eternity - the recipe for success.

Yet, this quest for packing as much as possible in every minute misses something important. **It misses our humanity.** 

When life is treated as a giant checklist, our instinct is to burn through our checklist as quickly as possible. We robotically bounce from task to task, like a pinball bouncing off the bumpers in a machine. *It may feel like we're in control, but we're enslaved to our task list.*

The task list never empties, either - it grows faster than than we can possibly burn it down. Like Sisyphus rolling his boulder up a hill, we resign ourselves to an eternal grind. While there's a brief sense of accomplishment with each task, it's quickly erased when we check our list again and see the mountain of work remaining.

But when we view each of those tasks as an experience to savor, something magical happens.

When I was in school, playing the piano was a chore. My parents wanted me to practice 30 minutes a day, and I hated every minute of it. My practicing was low quality, and it showed in my lack of progress. After over a decade of playing the piano, I hadn't progressed much beyond where I started. In high school, I unceremoniously stopped lessons and stopped playing.

On a whim, I bought myself a digital piano in college. I wasn't taking lessons. The piano was no longer an obligation, it was just *there*. I found myself playing again, this time for fun. While practicing for 30 minutes was a complete chore during school, now I found myself organically playing for much longer. The quality of my playing had increased, too. **When piano was no longer a chore on a timer, the quality of my experience increased.**

Giving myself the time to naturally ease into everything I do, taking the time to enjoy it, and reflecting on my accomplishments not only increases my satisfaction but also the quality of my work. I've found the "nap mindset" to be a great way to frame every aspect of my life.

Speaking of which, I think it's the perfect time for a nap. 

*Siri - set a 36 minute timer*.
