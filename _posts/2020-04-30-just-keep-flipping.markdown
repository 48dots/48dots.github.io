*Flip. Flip. Flip. Flip.*

A week earlier, I excitedly tore open the packaging to my brand new time tracking cube. I eagerly wrote different activities on the sides - "Cooking", "Eating", "Studying", "Reading", "Working", "Piano Practice". Even "Pooping"!

The premise of this device was simple. Just write everything you do during the day on the sides, and synchronize it with your phone. Whichever side of the cube is facing up is the task you're currently working. All was compiled in live reports of my time usage.

I tapped 'pair' on my phone, and the statistics started streaming in. The device delivered on every promise the website guaranteed. *So why was I boxing it back up and printing out a return label just a week later?* 

Let's go back to the root - what did I think a hundred dollar plastic cube was going to do for me in the first place?

I've been fighting distractions for years. My college lectures often consisted of a forty-five minute scroll through a Facebook feed, with the occasional glance up at my professor. At least I wasn't skipping class, right?

It was different now, though. After graduating, **my life was on my own terms**. I had a choice in everything I did, every use of my time. While I could live out every eight-year-old's fantasy - eating entire tubs of ice cream whenever I wanted, staying in bed and playing Xbox all day, I knew that wasn't what I wanted to do.

I could rationalize it in a million different ways, but deep down I knew **I had squandered my potential** to be a star performer in college. I had sabotaged myself by scrolling on my phone instead of listening to lectures or studying for exams. I could see myself making the same mistakes again. If I wanted to realize my potential, I needed to take control of my time and ensure it wasn't wasted. 

I had already tried a string of tricks to manage my time, but these all inevitably led to failure. The allure of a device allowing me to track all my time with minimal effort was irresistible. This was it. This was my silver bullet.

Of course, things always work out better in your head than they do in reality. Little did I realize as I charged into this new way of tracking my time that I was dooming myself to failure.

*Are there more seconds in a day than grains of sand in an hourglass?

There are 86,400 seconds in a day. I decided I would track every single one of them. Easy, right? In practice, this meant that I was always on the clock, and time tracking was always at the top of my mind. **I was utterly overwhelmed.** 

I soldiered on. More awareness was a good thing, I told myself. It was well worth the trade-off for a little added stress. I became addicted to the data, and started making changes based on the live graphs that I saw. **Less time pooping, more time working.**

Getting accurate data meant that I had to constantly flip the cube, sometimes multiple times a minute. But I'm human, and humans make mistakes. Sometimes I would forget to flip the cube when I changed tasks. *Disaster.* A whole thirty minutes of data ruined. **I was holding myself to an impossible standard.**

Nevertheless, I was able to gather mostly accurate data for my days. But I hadn't set any expectations for what I was going to do with this data. I didn't focus on any particular aspect of my life, instead recording everything. Reviewing the data was just as overwhelming as the process of recording it.

Although I tried making changes on the fly based on the data, they were mostly local optimizations that didn't affect the big picture. What difference did it make if I spent 30 less seconds on the toilet? Not to mention, sometimes inspiration hits in the most unlikely places. Perhaps I was making my end results worse by micromanaging my time so closely.

But even a failed experiment offers opportunities to grow. While every second does count, **perhaps every second doesn't have to be measured**. Time spent is just one metric that quantifies how we spend our days. By trying to catalog every single thing I did in my life, *I was reducing the quality of that time*. These days, I don't have a fancy bluetooth cube on my desk - just a pen and paper. I don't document every single second - just the main accomplishments I aim to achieve in my day. But I can focus on what really matters, and **enjoy every second of it**.
